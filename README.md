The jquery-picture-tag file will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. Add this line in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```

### Rails 3.0 (or greated with asset pipeline disabled)

To copy the jquery-picture-tag file into `public/javascripts` run:

```


## Usage

Use the proposed HTML `<picture>` tag syntax.
ProTipâ„¢: Use [picture_tag-rails](https://github.com/G5/picture_tag-rails).

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 980px)" srcset="images/large.jpg 1x">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="images/medium.jpg 1x">
  <source srcset="images/small.jpg 1x"> 
  <img src="images/small.jpg" alt=""> 
</picture>
```

Put this Javascript somewhere to apply it to all `<picture>` tags.

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('picture').pictureTag();
});
```

Or this to apply it to just some `<picture>` tags.

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('.gallery picture').pictureTag();
});
```
