# jQuery Picture Tag for Rails

Works great with [Picture Tag Rails](https://github.com/G5/picture_tag-rails)!


## Current Version

0.0.1


## Requirements

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [matchMedia.js](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js) for older browsers
* [railties](http://rubygems.org/gems/railties) >= 3.0.0


## Installation

### Gemfile

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jquery_picture_tag-rails'
```

### Manual

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install jquery_picture_tag-rails
```

### Rails 3.1 or greater (with asset pipeline enabled)

The jquery-picture-tag file will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. 

Add this line in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```javascript
//= require jquery-picture-tag
```

### Rails 3.0 (or greated with asset pipeline disabled)

Copy the jquery-picture-tag file into `public/javascripts`:

```bash
rails generate jquery_picture_tag:install
```

Include the jquery-picture-tag into your application: 

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "jquery-picture-tag" %>
```


## Usage

Use the [W3C Picture Element Proposal](http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/)'s `<picture>` tag syntax.
ProTipâ„¢: Use [picture_tag-rails](https://github.com/G5/picture_tag-rails) to generate it for you.

```html
<picture alt="Kitty cat!">
  <source media="(min-width: 1600px)" srcset="cat-huge.jpg 1x,   cat-huge@2x.jpg 2x">
  <source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="cat-large.jpg 1x,  cat-large@2x.jpg 2x">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)"  srcset="cat-medium.jpg 1x, cat-medium@2x.jpg 2x">
  <source media="(min-width: 480px)"  srcset="cat-small.jpg 1x,  cat-small@2x.jpg 2x">
  <source                             srcset="cat-tiny.jpg 1x,   cat-tiny@2x.jpg 2x">
  <img alt="Kitty cat!"               src="cat-tiny.jpg">
</picture>
```

Put this Javascript somewhere to apply it to all `<picture>` tags.

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('picture').pictureTag();
});
```

Or this to apply it to just some `<picture>` tags.

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('.gallery picture').pictureTag();
});
```
